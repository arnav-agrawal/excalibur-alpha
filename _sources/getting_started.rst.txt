Getting Started
---------------

The Run.py file is where the end-user will spend most of their time. The user can use the ``summon`` function
to download line lists, the ``compute_cross_section`` function to compute cross-sections, and the ``plot_sigma_wl``
function to plot the results of the output cross-sections.

We will work through each of these in turn to demonstrate how to use the Run.py file.

1) The ``summon`` function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's take a look at the ``summon`` function and the arguments it takes before seeing how to use it.

.. code:: ipython3

  def summon(database = '', species = '', isotope = 'default', VALD_data_dir = '',
         linelist = 'default', ionization_state = 1, **kwargs):

We see that users can specify:

 * the database
 * species
 * isotope
 * VALD_data_dir (the relative path to the folder we have provided containing VALD line lists)
 * linelist (usually for ExoMol where there are multiple line lists for each molecule)
 * ionization_state (for VALD atomic line lists)

You can use as many, or as few of these arguments as desired. The minimum required is the database and species.

Example 1: Downloading the H20 line list from HITRAN

.. code:: python

  from excalibur.core import summon

  species = 'H2O'
  database = 'HITRAN'

  # Download line list
  summon(database=database, species = species)

Example 2: Downloading the BT2 line list for H2O from ExoMol
The default line list for H2O is the Pokazatel line list, but say we want to download the BT2 line list for some reason.

.. code:: python

  from excalibur.core import summon

  species = 'H2O'
  database = 'ExoMol'
  linelist = 'BT2'

  # Download line list
  summon(database=database, species = species, linelist = linelist)


Example 3: Downloading the line list of the second ionization state of oxygen from VALD

.. code:: python

  from excalibur.core import summon

  species = 'O'
  database = 'VALD'
  ionization_state = 2
  VALD_data_dir = './VALD Line Lists/'


  # Download line list
  summon(database=database, species = species, ionization_state =  ionization_state, VALD_data_dir = VALD_data_dir)

Keep in mind that a path needs to be specified to read in the VALD line lists we have provided.
Assuming that the user hasn't moved this 'VALD Line Lists' folder anywhere, the path we use here
will work as a default.

The line lists will all be downloaded in an 'input' folder that is one directory above where the exclibur-alpha folder is
stored on your local machine.


2) The ``compute_cross_section`` function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to compute the cross-section of a species at a given temperature and presssure.
For info on computing cross sections for a grid of temperatures and pressures on a cluster, please see the 'Cluster Run'
section.

Let's look at the ``compute_cross_section`` function.

.. code:: python

  def compute_cross_section(input_dir, database, species, log_pressure, temperature, isotope = 'default',
                              ionization_state = 1, linelist = 'default', cluster_run = False,
                              nu_out_min = 200, nu_out_max = 25000, dnu_out = 0.01, broad_type = 'default',
                              X_H2 = 0.85, X_He = 0.15, Voigt_cutoff = 500, Voigt_sub_spacing = (1.0/6.0),
                              N_alpha_samples = 500, S_cut = 1.0e-100, cut_max = 30.0, **kwargs):

Most of these arguments take on a default value. The ones the user has to worry about is:

  - input_dir (the prefix of the folder where the line list is stored, use the one we provided as a default)
  - database
  - species
  - log_pressure
  - temperature

Specify the database, species, log_pressure, and temperature to compute a cross-section for a species with
those specifications (assuming the line list has already been downloaded)

Example 1: Compute the cross-section for H2O (HITRAN line list) at 1 bar and 1200 Kelvin

.. code:: python

  species = 'H2O'
  database = 'HITRAN'

  P = 1       # Pressure (bar)
  T = 1200    # Temperature (K)

  nu, sigma = compute_cross_section(input_dir = './input/', database = database,
                                    species = species, log_pressure = np.log10(P),
                                    temperature = T)


The results of this are stored in .txt files with wavenumber in the left column and sigma in the right column.
Note that ``nu`` and ``sigma`` are returned by the ``compute_cross_section`` function. These are used, as shown in the next section,
to plot cross-section.

3) The ``plot_sigma_wl`` function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows how to plot an outputted cross-section.

Let's look at the  ``plot_sigma_wl`` function.

.. code:: python

  def plot_sigma_wl(species, temperature, log_pressure, nu_arr = [], sigma_arr = [],
                    file = '', database = '', plot_dir = './plots/', **kwargs):

Most of these arguments take on a default value. The ones the user has to worry about is:

  - species
  - temperature
  - log_pressure
  - nu_arr (nu array to plot)
  - sigma_arr (sigma array to plot)
  - plot_dir (where the plot will be stored, default is a folder called 'plots' one directory out)

``species``, ``temperature``, and ``log_pressure`` are used to name the outputted file appropriately.
Currently, we do not support passing in files to be plotted by this function, but that is in the works.

Here is an example of the ``plot_sigma_wl`` function and the plot it produces, using the nu and sigma arrays returned
from Example 2.

.. code:: python

  species = 'H2O'
  database = 'HITRAN'

  P = 1       # Pressure (bar)
  T = 1200    # Temperature (K)

  # Plot cross section
  plot_sigma_wl(nu_arr = nu, sigma_arr = sigma, species = species, temperature = T,
                log_pressure = np.log10(P), database = database, plot_dir = './plots/')
